# 🧾 Machine Learning Project: Fraud Detection

This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in a banking dataset.

## 📁 Project Overview
- Dataset: Bank transaction data with transaction, demographic, and device information.
- Goal: Classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine using multiple ML models and ensemble techniques.
- Techniques Used: SMOTE for imbalance, Label Encoding, Log Transformation, XGBoost, Random Forest, Deep Learning (MLP), Ensemble Learning, ROC Analysis.

## 📌 Notebook Structure
- 1. Importing Necessary Libraries
- 2. Load Dataset
- 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 4. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- 5. Train-Test Split and SMOTE
- 6. Model Training: Random Forest & XGBoost
- 7. Deep Learning Model: MLP
- 8. Model Evaluation: Metrics & ROC
- 9. Ensemble Model: Soft Voting
- 10. Error Analysis
- 11. Learning Curve: Random Forest
- 12. Timing Analysis
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the dataset `bank_transactions_data_2.csv`.
2. Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom.
3. Visualizations, metrics, and model evaluations will be printed along the way.

## 📊 Output
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC for XGBoost, Random Forest, Deep Learning, and Ensemble.
- ROC curves for all models.
- Learning curve for Random Forest.
- Misclassification analysis and model timing.
